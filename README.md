# Microservices with Spring Cloud ![CI status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

In this tutorial we will understand the microservices architecture and implement the same with Spring Cloud.we will understand and implement the below concepts.

Lets take a quick look into the terminologies on a higher level :

**Feign**  – declarative REST client

**Ribbon**  – client side load balancer

**Eureka** – service registration and discovery

**Zuul Gateway** –  gateway service that provides dynamic routing, monitoring, resiliency, security, and more

**Sleuth** - distributed tracing via logs

**Zipkin** - distributed tracing system with request visualization.

Below are the post which will go through the step by step implementation of microsevices with spring cloud.

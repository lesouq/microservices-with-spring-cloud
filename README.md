# Microservices with Spring Cloud

**[Microservices Tutorial](https://onlyfullstack.blogspot.com/p/microservices.html)**

In this tutorial we will understand the microservices architecture and implement the same with Spring Cloud.we will understand and implement the below concepts.

Lets take a quick look into the terminologies on a higher level : <br/>
**Feign**  – declarative REST client <br/>
**Ribbon**  – client side load balancer <br/>
**Eureka** – service registration and discovery <br/>
**Zuul Gateway** –  gateway service that provides dynamic routing, monitoring, resiliency, security, and more <br/>
**Sleuth –** distributed tracing via logs <br/>
**Zipkin –** distributed tracing system with request visualization. <br/>

Below are the post which will go through the step by step implementation of microsevices with spring cloud.
